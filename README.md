# Advent-of-code-2017

Advent of code 2017 (http://adventofcode.com/2017) solved on my free time.
Took me more and more of my free time until I decided I took too much, and quit !

Every bit of code was made with Swift Playground, but some were executed compiled with Swift optimizations to make it quicker to solve. (Since Swift Playground is way slower than classical compiled execution)
